## üõ°Ô∏è Skills Gained
‚úÖ **Database Integration with Metabase**: Connecting Metabase to a specific database (e.g., 'computer_store') to enable effective data analysis and visualization.  
‚úÖ **Metabase Dashboard Creation**: Created interactive dashboards using Metabase to visualize key business statistics, such as most purchased products, top product categories, best customers, and sales revenues.
‚úÖ **SQL Query Formulation**: Writing SQL queries to extract and analyze data from databases, facilitating the generation of meaningful business insights.

## üîß Tools Used  
| Tool            | Description |
|----------------|------------|
| **Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) & Subnets** | A logical isolated network that can lauch AWS resource into, and a subnet is a range of IP addresses with that VPC. |
| **Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS)** | A web service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the AWS cloud. |
| **Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)** | A web service that lets users run applications in the cloud. |
| **Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)** | An easy-to-use, scalable, high-performance block-storage service designed for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2). |
| **Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)** | A fully managed container orchestration service that helps you to more efficiently deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications. |
| **Amazon Elastic File System (EFS)** | A fully managed, serverless file storage service for AWS that allows you to share files across multiple AWS compute instances and on-premises resources, scaling automatically to meet your needs.  |
| **Docker** | A software platform that allows you to build, test, and deploy applications quickly. |
| **phpMyAdmin** | A free software tool written in PHP, intended to handle the administration of MySQL, MariaDB, and AWS Aurora over the Web. |
| **Metabase** | An open-source data visualization and exploration tool that empowers users to connect to their data sources, create interactive dashboards, and gain insights from their data with ease. |
